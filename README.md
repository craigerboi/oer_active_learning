# OER active learning

This repository contains the code required to perform active learning for the oxygen evolution reaction with homogeneous catalysts, the accompanying paper was published in [Molecules](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/21/6362).

## Installing packages

Use the package and environment manager [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) to install the necessary software.

```bash
conda env create -f oer_active.yml
```

## Data

The [RACs](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2017/sc/c7sc01247k), and binding energy data is found in the racs_and_desc directory. The data for the binding energies was generated by analysing the gaussian output logfiles.

## Running

Each notebook works as a standalone once the data is forked.
